============

R1	Implement no less than four HTML documents which link together and share a common theme, including components to present the following information:
- Your name and contact details
- Links to professional accounts such as Github and LinkedIn
- Your work and/or study history and a link to a PDF of your resumé (resume can be a mock up)
- Content about you to demonstrate your personality, skills and/or interests
- A list of blog posts with titles and date published
- A blog with FIVE sample posts (placeholder text can be used), blog posts need to have at least ONE image each

==========

R2	Create FOUR components which contain text content that are styled appropriately for audience. You must:
- write CSS to style each component, or substantially override a CSS framework’s styles with your own
- place comments in the CSS and HTML code to identify each component
- have your custom styles or overrides in a separate stylesheet
- use semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and accessibility

===========

R3	Create FOUR components using HTML and CSS to contain graphical content that are appropriate for audience. You must:
- write CSS to style each component, or substantially override a CSS framework’s styles with your own
- place comments in the CSS and HTML code to indentify each component
- have your custom styles or overrides in a separate stylesheet
- use semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and accessibility

NOTE: you may create a component to contain an image and caption that could be reused across the site.

=========

R4	Create a responsive layout for each page using HTML and CSS utilising Flexbox and/or CSS Grid to produce a responsive layout that:
- will display all components at desktop, mobile, and tablet viewport widths
- includes a navigation bar and/or header/sidebar

All components should:
- use valid HTML5 elements
- use semantic HTML elements and attributes to add meaning and accessibility	
14

===========

R5	Utilise source control to track the development of the project and to provide different THREE versions of the site on different branches. The three different versions of the site can have slight cosmetic differences such as:
- a different colour theme or styles for a component(s)
- a different font(s)
- a different layout

Deploy the application to an online platform to make it publicly accessible

==========

R6	Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) to enable browsers to verify that resources they fetch are delivered without unexpected manipulation.6
